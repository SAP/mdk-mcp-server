  "description": "ActionBar is the navigation bar that appears at the top of a page. Action items can be added to the action bar to execute actions on the context of the page.\nBack navigation button will be automatically added to the action bar when navigation occurred.\nWhen there are too many items on the `ActionBar`, an overflow button would appear automatically on top right corner which would display the overflown items as popover menu items. The max number of allowed visible items is based on the device type (tablet or phone) and item type (text or icon). On tablet, the max visible items (including overflow button) is 4 for icon only items and 3 if text item is present. On phone the max visible items (including overflow button) is 3 for icon only items and 2 if text item is present.\n\nThe `ActionBar` can support styling at two different levels:\n\nApplication-level styling: This is done by defining a type selector CSS with the predefined type names `ActionBar` (using the color property to style the color of the caption, subhead, text items, and icon tint, and the background-color property to style the background color of the `ActionBar`; for Android, the same background color is applied to the status bar as well) and `ActionBarTitle` (to style the caption, large caption, and subhead).\n\nPage-level styling: This is done by defining a CSS class name (class selector) for a subview or property in `ActionBar.Styles` or `ActionBar.Items.Style`.",
