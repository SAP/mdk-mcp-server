Each tab page should contain content that is distinct from other tab pages in a set. Tabs is used to create sort of pager to browse between items that have the same context.\n\nTabs can support unlimited tab items. Tabs supports positioning of the tab bar (Top/Bottom), and Swipe gesture to switch between tab pages.\n\nThe tab pages of the Tabs would preserve its last state once the tab page is loaded, so that when user switch to another tab item and switch back to the previous tab item, they return to the last screen viewed.\n\nTabs does not support inner navigation (navigation on tab page level), any navigation action triggered from the tab page content would result in a navigation on the parent page level or similar to outer navigation on BottomNavigation.\n\nParent Page with Tabs may have Toolbar control defined on the same page.\nTabs has nested Tabs support. It is not recommended to display BottomNavigation as nested control of Tabs."
