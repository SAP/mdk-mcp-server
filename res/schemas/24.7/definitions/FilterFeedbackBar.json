    "description": "A horizontal bar displayed below `ActionBar` / `SearchBar` that includes filter feedback items. It uses area interactive chips to communicate which filters have been applied to the list, and allows users to quickly apply frequently-used filters. Users can scroll the bar horizontally to see any additional items that may be off-screen. Please note that `AllowEmptySelection` and `AllowMultipleSelection` are not supported yet on `FilterFeedbackBar`, so currently all fast filter items will always allow empty selection and multiple selections. Please avoid to use `AllowEmptySelection` and `AllowMultipleSelection` on form cell controls in standard filters if you intend to use `FilterFeedbackBar` as well.\nSpecifically for iOS, `FilterFeedbackBar` cannot be displayed if `FilterFeedbackBar` is defined on `SectionedTable` with 'ObjectHeader` as first section.",
