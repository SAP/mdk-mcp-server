This date range view allows the user to select a contiguous range of dates. The `IsPersistentSelection` property is disregarded in DateRange `CalendarType`, the selected date range stays selected regardless of scrolling to another month. \n\nThe first date selected is the start date of the range and when a second date is selected it becomes the end date of the range, with the entire range of dates between the start and end dates (inclusive) being selected. The end date of the range must be a later date than the start date. If start date is selected, when selecting another date that is earlier than the start date, the new date becomes the new selected start date.\n\nFor modifying the set of selected dates, on iOS, click on a selected date within existing range and it becomes the new end date with all the dates later than that getting deselected. To unselect the entire range, click outside the range, anywhere in the calendar view. While for Android, any click on date within or outside the existing range would result in unselecting the existing range.
